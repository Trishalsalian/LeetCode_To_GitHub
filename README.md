# LeetCode_To_GitHub
Python tool to search your solutions from LeetCode (https://leetcode.com/problemset/algorithms/) and transfer them to your GitHub account automagically.

It is planned to add support for cron and enable a scheduled commit per day with one of the exported problems not yet uploaded on GitHub. Just to boost your streak for a while!
